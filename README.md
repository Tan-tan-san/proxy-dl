proxy-dl
========

proxy-dl is a CLI program that proxies your downloads with wget, through Tor. I have included the proxychains.conf file you need in /etc/ for this to work.

Requirements:
-Tor installed; running
-Proxychains with included conf file.

*Note:If you prefer to see the proxychain download details, remove the &> /dev/null at the end of the proxychain command.
